## Technical Implementation Details

### Routing Fix Implementation
```typescript
// New IndustryDetail.tsx component
const industryComponents = useMemo(() => ({
  "government-regtech": GovernmentRegTech,
  "financial-services": FinancialServices,
  "energy": Energy,
  // ... all industry mappings
}), []);

// Proper error handling for missing pages
if (!IndustryComponent) {
  return <ErrorFallback />;
}
```

### Enhanced Form Validation
```typescript
// RFC-compliant email validation
const emailRegex = /^[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?)*$/;

// International phone validation with formatting support
const phoneRegex = /^[\+]?[1-9][\d]{0,15}$/;
const cleanPhone = formData.phone.replace(/[\s\-\(\)]/g, '');

// Enhanced error handling with status code differentiation
if (response.status === 429) {
  errorMessage = "Too many requests. Please wait a moment before trying again.";
} else if (response.status >= 500) {
  errorMessage = "Server error. Please try again later.";
}
```
